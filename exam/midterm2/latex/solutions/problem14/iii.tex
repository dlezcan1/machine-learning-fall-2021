If $X_i$ is MCAR and $Y$ is always observed, then we have that 
\begin{equation*}
    p(x_i^{(1)}) = p(x_i \given r_i = 1)
\end{equation*}
Therefore, using this, we have that
\begin{equation*}
    p(\Tilde{x}_i \given x_i^{(1)}) = p(\Tilde{x}_i \given x_i, r_i=1)
\end{equation*}
So maximizing the likelihood would be equivalent as maximizing likelihood over the fully-observed data rows.
