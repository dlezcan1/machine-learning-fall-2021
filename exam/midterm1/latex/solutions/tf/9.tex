The goal for an SVM is to maximize the margin between two classes. Therefore, in order to calculate a margin, at the minimum, it will need one vector from each class that are the closest to the (linear) decision boundary to define the margin. Otherwise, the margin may not be maximized should the SVM only have one support vector (i.e. maximum between a single support vector is $\infty$).
