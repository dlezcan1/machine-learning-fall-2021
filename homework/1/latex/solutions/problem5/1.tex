For binary random variables, there are $2$ options per variable and $k$ total random variables. The total number of options that the joint distribution can take are $2^k$. However, the restriction that $\sum_{\{x_i ~|~ i \in \{1,\dots,k\}\}}p(x_1,\dots,x_k) = 1$ is a constraint such that we can deduce one of the outcomes from the other distributions, i.e $p(x_1, \dots, x_k = 0) = 1-\sum p(x_1, \dots, x_k=1)$. Therefore the size of the joint probability table is $\mathbf{2^k - 1}$.
