\begin{align*}
p(fever)&=p(f)=0.2 \\
p(pneumonia)&=p(p)=0.05 \\
p(cough|pneumonia)&=p(c|p)=0.7 \\
p(fever|pneumonia)&=p(f|p)=0.5 \\
p(cough|fever)&=p(c|f)=0.4 \\
\\
P(c\cap f)&=p(c|f)\times p(f)=0.4\times 0.2 = 0.08 \\
\end{align*} % use can use & to delimit your equations and align them, soft of like that with &=, it'll align all of the first "=" signes on the left and right.
