% If $[D]$ is balanced, we fill find that the variance of the split learner will be lower than of the unsplit learner, however if $[D]$ is unbalanced, we will observe a high variance over all of the potential splits of data which would increase the variance of our split learner. A split learner would generalize better to a balanced data set distribution and an unsplit learner would generalize better to an imbalanced data set distribution.
For small $n$ (small $[D]$), dataset imbalance can greatly increase the variance of the split model. For large $n$, the variance of each of the individual models $\hat{f}^{whole}, \hat{f}^{(1)},$ and $\hat{f}^{(2)}$ will essentially there by allowing for a smaller variance in the split model by about a factor of 2. % this is an argument without adding any of the math. When the math is all present, we can go ahead and add that in if we like. The TA did say a qualitative answer is also good too however.
