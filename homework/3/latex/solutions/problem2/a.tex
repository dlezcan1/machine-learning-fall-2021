We would need three classifiers to each of the different classes. We would have the following:
$$
\mathbb{I}_i(y)(w_i^T x + b_i) > 1, ~\forall i = 1,2,3
$$
Where $\mathbb{I}_i(y) = \begin{cases} +1, &y = i\\
-1, &y \neq i
\end{cases}$.
Therefore, we need to find 3 sets of $(w_i, b_i)$ that classifies the distinction of Class $i$ and not Class $i$ for $i = 1,2,3$. 
% $w$ is vector $b$ is bias and
